# Layoffs-Data-Analysis-Project

This project focuses on data preprocessing and exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand global layoff trends across companies, industries, countries, and time periods.

The goal is to clean raw data, remove inconsistencies, and extract meaningful insights using SQL.

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies

- SQL

- MySQL

## 📊 Detailed Analysis

The analysis was carried out after thoroughly cleaning and standardizing the raw layoffs dataset. The focus was on identifying meaningful patterns, trends, and business insights related to workforce reductions across companies, industries, regions, and time periods.

### 1️⃣ Overall Layoff Trends

- Analyzed total layoffs over time to understand how workforce reductions evolved year by year.

- Identified peak layoff periods, highlighting phases of economic slowdown and recovery.

- Observed sharp spikes during specific years, indicating macroeconomic or industry-wide stress.

### 2️⃣ Company-Level Analysis

- Examined layoffs by individual companies to identify organizations with the highest workforce reductions.

- Compared repeated layoffs across multiple years to detect companies with persistent restructuring issues.

- Highlighted large-scale layoffs versus one-time events.

### 3️⃣ Industry-Wise Analysis

- Aggregated layoffs by industry to determine which sectors were most affected.

- Technology, finance, and consumer-facing industries showed higher volatility compared to others.

- Helped identify cyclical vs. structurally impacted industries.

### 4️⃣ Country & Region Analysis

- Evaluated layoffs by country to understand geographic concentration.

- Compared layoffs across major economies to identify regional trends.

- Observed higher layoffs in regions with heavy startup and tech concentration.

### 5️⃣ Layoff Severity Analysis

- Analyzed both total laid-off employees and percentage laid off to differentiate:

- Large companies with moderate cuts

- Smaller companies with severe workforce reductions

- This provided a clearer picture of organizational impact beyond raw numbers.

### 6️⃣ Funding & Layoffs Relationship

- Studied layoffs in relation to company funding stages.

- Identified trends showing how late-stage and well-funded startups still faced layoffs during downturns.

- Highlighted risk patterns across funding cycles.

### 7️⃣ Time-Based Insights

- Used date-based analysis to observe seasonal and yearly patterns.

- Detected clustering of layoffs during specific quarters, reflecting budget cycles and market conditions.

## 🔍 Key Insights

- Layoffs are highly concentrated during economic uncertainty periods.

- Certain industries are consistently more vulnerable to workforce reductions.

- Large funding does not fully insulate companies from layoffs.

- Percentage-based analysis is critical to understanding true business impact.
